## Chat Management

AgentHub allows you to maintain multiple separate chat sessions, making it easy to organize different topics or projects.

### Creating a New Chat

- Click the "+ New Chat" button in the sidebar to start a fresh conversation.
- Each new chat automatically receives a unique identifier and is initialized with an empty canvas.

### Managing Multiple Chats

- All your chats are listed in the sidebar, showing the chat name and last updated date.
- Chats are sorted with the most recent at the top.
- Chat names are automatically generated based on the first message you send, making it easy to identify conversations.

### Switching Between Chats

- Click on any chat in the sidebar to switch to that conversation.
- When switching, the chat history and any generated content are restored, providing a seamless experience.
- Your complete interaction history and generated content for each chat are preserved between sessions.

### Deleting Chats

- Each chat in the sidebar has a delete button (Ã—).
- Clicking this button removes the chat and all associated content.
- If you delete the current chat, AgentHub will automatically switch to another existing chat or create a new one.

## Canvas for Generated Content

The Canvas panel provides a dedicated space to display and manage content generated by the AI.

### Content Types and Formats

AgentHub supports a wide range of content types:

1. **Code** - Programming source code in various languages
2. **Documents** - Text and formatted documents

Supported formats include:

- **Programming Languages**: Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, C++, C, C#, Ruby, Go, Rust, Swift, PHP, and many more
- **Markup & Configuration**: Markdown, HTML, XML, CSS, JSON, YAML
- **Documents**: Plain text, Markdown formatted text

### Syntax Highlighting

The Canvas provides robust syntax highlighting for different content types:

- **Language Detection**: Automatically detects and applies the appropriate syntax highlighting.
- **Dark Theme**: Code is displayed in a dark theme optimized for readability.
- **Language-specific Highlighting**: Special tokens, keywords, and syntax elements are highlighted according to language conventions.

### Content Management Features

#### Copy to Clipboard

- Each generated content block has a "Copy" button that copies the entire content to your clipboard.
- Visual feedback confirms when content has been successfully copied.

#### Save Functionality

The Canvas offers two saving options:

1. **Local Download**:
   - Click the "Save" button to download the content as a file to your local machine.
   - Files are named with content type, timestamp, and appropriate extension.

2. **Server Storage**:
   - Toggle the "Keep on server" checkbox to also save the content on the server.
   - This enables persistence and potential sharing of generated content.

#### Expand/Collapse

- Long code blocks can be expanded or collapsed for better readability.
- The "Expand" button toggles between compact and full view modes.

### Canvas Resizing

- The canvas panel width is adjustable by dragging the left edge.
- Your preferred width is remembered between sessions.
- Resizing the canvas dynamically adjusts the main chat area to maintain an optimal layout.
- This flexibility allows you to prioritize either conversation space or generated content based on your current needs.
- The minimum width constraints ensure both panels remain usable regardless of adjustment.

## Content Updates and Versioning

AgentHub provides sophisticated support for iterative content generation and updates.

### Update Requests

- You can ask AgentHub to update previously generated content (e.g., "Update the Python code to include error handling").
- The system intelligently identifies which content you're referring to.

### Version Management

- Update requests create new canvas items rather than overwriting existing ones.
- This allows easy comparison between different versions of generated content.
- Each version is independently copyable and savable.

### Content Persistence

- All canvas items are associated with their respective chats.
- When switching between chats, the correct canvas items are displayed.
- Canvas content is preserved even when refreshing the page or closing the browser.

## Interactive Chat Interface

The chat interface provides a rich conversational experience with the AI assistant.

### Message Display

- Messages are clearly labeled as either "You" or "Assistant".
- AI responses support Markdown formatting, including:
  - Code blocks with syntax highlighting
  - Lists and tables
  - Headings and text formatting
  - Links and images

### Contextual Understanding

- The assistant maintains context throughout the conversation.
- You can reference previous messages and generated content.
- The AI can analyze and respond to complex multi-turn dialogues.

### Detailed Explanations

- The assistant provides detailed explanations in the chat that complement generated content.
- Explanations help you understand the generated code or documents.
- The AI can elaborate on design decisions, algorithms, and implementation details.

## File Attachments

AgentHub supports file attachments to enhance context and input for the AI.

### Attaching Files

- Click the attachment button or drag and drop files into the input area.
- Multiple files can be attached to a single message.
- Attached files are displayed with name and size information.

### File Processing

- Attached files can be analyzed by the AI to provide context-aware responses.
- Supported file types include text, code, and documents.
- The AI can reference and explain content from your attached files.

## Visual Feedback and UI Features

AgentHub provides clear visual cues to enhance user experience.

### Loading Indicators

- During content generation, a typing indicator appears in the chat.
- This visual feedback clearly shows when the AI is processing your request.
- The send button is disabled during generation to prevent conflicting requests.

### Error Handling

- Informative error messages are displayed when issues occur.
- Automatic retry mechanisms for temporary connection issues.
- Clear notifications for successful actions like copying or saving.

### Responsive Design

- The interface adapts to different screen sizes.
- The canvas panel can be resized to accommodate different content types.
- The main chat area and canvas dynamically resize in relation to each other, providing a flexible workspace.
- Font sizes and spacing are optimized for readability.
- Layout intelligently adjusts when the window is resized to maintain usability.

#### Dynamic Resizing Features

- **Interactive Divider**: The boundary between the chat and canvas areas can be dragged to adjust their relative sizes.
- **Persistent Preferences**: Your customized layout proportions are saved and restored between sessions.
- **Optimal Space Distribution**: When you resize one panel, the other automatically adjusts to maintain the overall layout integrity.
- **Content-Aware Resizing**: The system intelligently redistributes space based on the type and amount of content displayed.

## Advanced Features

### Language Detection

- AgentHub can automatically detect programming languages in code snippets.
- This enables proper syntax highlighting even when the language isn't explicitly specified.

### Web Search Integration

- For queries requiring current information, AgentHub can integrate web search results.
- This provides up-to-date context for responses.

### Document Processing

- Attached documents can be analyzed and processed.
- The AI can extract information, summarize content, and answer questions about documents.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

- If you see "Failed to load chat history" on startup, wait a moment for the backend to initialize.
- The application will automatically retry connecting to the backend services.

### Content Display Issues

- If syntax highlighting isn't working correctly, try clicking on the content area.
- For extremely large content, use the expand button for better visibility.

### Performance Optimization

- Chats with extensive history might load slower; consider creating new chats for new topics.
- Large file attachments may take longer to process.

## Technical Architecture

AgentHub consists of several microservices:

1. **Frontend**: React-based user interface
2. **Orchestrator**: Core service that manages AI interactions
3. **Document Service**: Handles document processing and analysis
4. **Web Search Service**: Provides web search capabilities

Each service is designed to scale independently, providing a robust and responsive user experience.
